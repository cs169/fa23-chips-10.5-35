Feature: Users can add and view issues for news items

  As a user,
  I want to be able to see which issue a news article relates to on the news article page 
  and to be able to choose which issue a news article is about,
  so I can be able to quickly find the articles that are relevant to me.

  Scenario: Editing News Item
    Given that Gavin Newson in database
    And that Gavin Newson has a news article
    And that I am logged in
    And that I am on "representatives/1/representatives/1/my_news_item/1"
    When I select "Free Speech" from "news_item_issue"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Free Speech"
